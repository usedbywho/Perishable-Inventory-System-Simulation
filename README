The parameters for the simulation are passed in through Parameters.txt, which has the following parameters and default values.
Simulation Length:10000        The length of each run of the simulation
Expiration Time:10             The time it takes for a unit of product to expire from the time it arrives at the inventory system
Arrival Rate:2                 The arrival rate of demands, which is a Poisson process
Lead Time:5                    The lead time of orders to suppliers
Starting Inventory:100         The initial inventory level of the inventory system, which is also the base stock level
Number of Runs:2               The number of simulation runs
Rationing Type:1               The type of rationing policy. 1-FIFO, 2-FILO, 3-Random
Ordering Type:1                The type of ordering policy. 1-Base stock, 2-Base stock with consideration for future disposals
